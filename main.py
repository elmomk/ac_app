# Instructions to run the API:
# Save this file as main.py.
# Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved it.
# Run the command:
# uvicorn main:app --reload

# The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
# The endpoint is http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/set-state
# Remember to replace the fake API URL in your HTML file with this address.
